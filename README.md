# PROJECT : Funtionnal Programming in OCaml

This project is to be done by : 

  -[TRAN Trong Hieu](https://github.com/kuro10)

  -[TRAN Le Minh](https://github.com/tranleminh)

a pair of students in 4IR, INSA Toulouse.

## How it goes ? 

The goal is to implement an algorithm computing the max-flow of a flow graph, using the Fordâ€“Fulkerson algorithm, and optionally improve it to take into account other constraints (e.g. minimize cost).
